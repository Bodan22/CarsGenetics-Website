    As technology has progressed, so have the safety features in cars. Today, modern cars are equipped with a range of advanced safety features that help protect drivers and passengers from accidents. These features include everything from airbags and seat belts to lane departure warnings and blind spot monitoring systems.
    <br><br>
    In this article, we will explore some of the most important car safety features that you should know about.
    <br><br>
    <li>Airbags</li>
    Airbags have been around for several decades now, and they have saved countless lives. These devices are designed to deploy in the event of an accident, cushioning the driver and passengers and preventing serious injuries. Modern cars typically have several airbags, including front airbags, side airbags, and curtain airbags.
    <br><br>
    <li>Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)</li>
    The Anti-lock Braking System, or ABS, is a safety feature that prevents the wheels from locking up when the driver applies the brakes suddenly. This allows the driver to maintain control of the car and avoid accidents. ABS has been standard in most cars for many years now.
    <br><br>
    <li>Electronic Stability Control (ESC)</li>
    Electronic Stability Control is a newer safety feature that uses sensors to detect when the car is losing traction or skidding. It then applies the brakes to individual wheels to help the driver regain control of the car. This feature has been mandatory in all new cars since 2012.
    <br><br>
    <li>Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM)</li>
    Blind Spot Monitoring uses sensors to detect when a car is in the driver's blind spot. This feature alerts the driver with an audible or visual warning when it's not safe to change lanes.
    <br><br>
    <li>Lane Departure Warning (LDW)</li>
    Lane Departure Warning systems use sensors to detect when the car is drifting out of its lane. The system then alerts the driver with a visual or audible warning, helping to prevent accidents caused by drifting or swerving.
    <br><br>
    <li>Rearview Cameras</li>
    Rearview cameras are an increasingly common safety feature in modern cars. These cameras provide drivers with a clear view of what's behind them, making it easier to back up and park safely.
    <br><br>
    <li>Adaptive Headlights</li>
    Adaptive headlights are a relatively new safety feature that adjusts the direction of the headlights based on the car's speed and steering angle. This ensures that the headlights are always pointing in the right direction, improving visibility and reducing the risk of accidents.
    <br><br>
    <li>Forward Collision Warning (FCW)</li>
    Forward Collision Warning systems use sensors to detect when the car is approaching another vehicle too quickly. The system then alerts the driver with an audible or visual warning, giving them time to react and avoid a collision.
    <br><br>
    <li>Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)</li>
    Automatic Emergency Braking is a feature that automatically applies the brakes if the car detects an imminent collision. This can help prevent accidents or reduce their severity.
    <br><br>
    <li>Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)</li>
    Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems alert drivers when the pressure in their tires is too low, helping to prevent blowouts and other tire-related accidents.
    <br><br>
    In conclusion, modern cars are equipped with a wide range of advanced safety features that can help prevent accidents and keep drivers and passengers safe. From airbags and seat belts to advanced technologies like blind spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking, these features are constantly evolving to provide even greater protection on the road. As a driver, it's important to stay informed about the latest safety features and to take advantage of them whenever possible.
